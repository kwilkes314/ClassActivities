// Follow the steps below to create a **while** loop that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

// 1) create a variable to represent the current number
let score=1;
// 2) create a variable to represent the current total
let ttotal=0;
// 3) write a while loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
while (score<=100){
  score=total=score;
  score++;
}

// Now using the same variables you created in steps 1 and 2, create a **for** loops that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100
for (let x = 1; x <= 100; x++) {
  console.log(total);
};
// 1) write a for loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
